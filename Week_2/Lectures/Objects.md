# Week 2 Lecture 1 – Objects in JS


## Seven Data Types
use typeof to check data types
- Boolean
- number – float or whole number
- symbol – introduced in 2015, symbol creates unique strings
- undefined
- null
- string – anything with quotation marks
- big int  - numbers that are larger 


## Non – Primitive Data Types

- non-primitive are stored by reference in memory instead of directly
- an object is a collection of key and value pairs
- can do functions in an object as well. 
- keyword 'this' can reference the current object
- 'this.name' – that references the object it is in
- use delete keyword to delete key/value pairs
- can get rid of the value by assigning it to null – that way you can keep the key if you want.

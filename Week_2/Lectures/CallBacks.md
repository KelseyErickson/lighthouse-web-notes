# Week 2 Lecture 2

## Callbacks

- what is a callback  - it is a function that gets passed to another function to be invoked by that new functions
- call backs use functions as values
- JS has passing values of functions not all languages can do this
- all functions are just values that can be used just like values
- JS coverts everything into an object
- so everything that is a value is also an object
- callbacks take other functions but not the return value of other functions

## Tips
- don’t write function declarations - instead use function expression
- need a return value otherwise it will return undefined. Needs an explicit return value
- practice writing functions as arrow functions from now on.
- less typing means less room for error
- try ysing ternary operators to replace if else statements to practice

## Terms
- expression – ability to calculate what it means
- passing – passing the value of the function as opposed to calling a function
- anonymous – something that has no value to it 
- ES6 – Ecma Script 6 – we write ecma script that is then translated to lower level JS – ES6 stole a lot from coffee script
- Higher Order Function – a function that accepts another function as an argument

## Note on Arrow Functions
- con is that they do not create ‘this’
- ’this’ refers to parent object – it does not work with an arrow functions if you ever see ‘this' - do not use an arrow function

# Notes on Week 1 Lecture 1

## Dev Work Flow

### Terms
- LTS - Long Term Support (stable). 
- IDE - Integrated Development Environment

### Tools

#### VSCode - IDE
- open project folders one at a time (project = git repo).
- maximize code area and use the terminal.

#### Git
- version control software
- lets you keep older versions of your code
- .git is the local folder the database is saving to 
- every once in awhile you want to commit these changes to a remote repository (we are using GitHub)
- 'git remote -v'  will shoe what remote repository is attached to your project
- do not use 'git add .' as this will add everything

### Approaching a Problem
- use const as a general rule then change to let if need be
- c style loop is not prefered unless you need the index for something
- solve your unknowns first and work incrementally
- work on edge cases
- give lots of space to be sure the code is readable
- add comments
- try to use the simplest wat to get the result
